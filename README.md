# About Me

# Web developer, full stack

I am a Web Developer with a focus on full-stack development. Currently, I am in the final year of my studies at Irkutsk National Research Technical University, pursuing a degree in Information Systems and Technologies.

I have a strong passion for web development and aspire to excel in this field. Additionally, I possess leadership qualities that I hope to leverage in my career.

I have a favorite project "Time check" â€” I am creating an application for tracking and analyzing the time spent at the PC to improve productivity and achieve results in work, study and other areas of life.

I am a big fan of hackathons for the unique atmosphere they offer and the opportunity they provide to develop both technical and soft skills.

In my leisure time, I enjoy cycling and staying active through various sports
