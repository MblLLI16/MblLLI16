### About Me :

### Web developer, full stack

I am finishing my 4th year at the Irkutsk National Research Technical University with a degree in **Information Systems and Technologies**.

I like **web development** and I want to become successful in this field. I also have leadership skills and hope to use them in my career.

I have a favorite project "Time check" â€” I am creating an application for tracking and analyzing the time spent at the PC to improve productivity and achieve results in work, study and other areas of life.

I really love hackathons for their atmosphere and the opportunity to develop hard and soft skills.

In my leisure time, I enjoy cycling and staying active through various sports
